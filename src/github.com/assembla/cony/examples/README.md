# Examples

## Basic

This is the base example meant to show how to use cony.
The producer will publish a message every second (or until you stop the program with CTRL-C).
The consumer will run forever (or until you stop the program with CTRL-C).
Both applications are CLI-based.

## Web

Example that illustrates how to use cony with a web-flow.
The producer is a simple web application. It allows to set the body of a "publishing" from a web-form.
The consumer is a CLI-application that shows the contents of each publishing it receives.

## Email

Example that illustrates having multiple workers handling a particular job.
In this case the producer is used to show a simple form for filling in some email fields.
The consumer launches a gorouting that receives deliveries and then balances these between 3 worker goroutines that actually do the email sending.
